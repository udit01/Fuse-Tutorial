Lab 8. CS333. Autumn 2017
--------------------------

1. lab8.pdf describes the lab statement.

3. The directory 'test-program' contains a sample test
   program to verify correctness of your implementation.

   Run this test program program as 
   testcase <number-of-children>
   Eg. : $testcase 10

4. The directory 'sample-input' contains different 
   priority order for child processes. Run different test case
   using the given test program by changing the priority of child
   processes.

5. The directory 'sample-output' contains sample outputs for
   both task2 and task3. In both the sample outputs, the priority
   order of child processes is in increasing order.
